As part of Coder Academy Diploma of IT we are required to design our own personal portfolio using only HTML and CSS.  

Description 

As I am just at very early stage in the course, I have used the opportunity to showcase projects and work experiences that I have accomplished in my current life as project marketing for property developments. My first objective is to design a website that I can further enhanced and add features and functionalities throughout the course and my working life, hence simplicity and flexibility is a priority over graphics and motions.  

Purpose 

Functionality 

Easiness to use and simplicity is a priority hence I implemented a fixed position navigation bar to guide users throughout elements in the website.  

I also intend the website to be modular so I decided to use flex display to give flexibility and responsiveness to the website.  

I love colors but I try not to give too much weight to the purpose of the website to show case my skills and previous work achievements, so I use a paralax design and give the website a colorful background whilst maintaining the main feature of the website stays as black and white. 

I prioritize mobile first in design but I also compatible with desktops and the flex display is flexible to various display size.  

With a single-page scroll and a responsive navigation bar which transitions from a menu bar to a hamburger menu, users can navigate to each section via scroll or via anchor links from the menu

Short Answers 

Question 1 

 Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words) 

Jan1, 1983    ARPANET adopted TCP/IP 

Researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world 

1990    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. The web helped popularize the Internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis. 

In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4] 

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[5] 

 

 

 

Question 2 

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words) 

Internet: Integrated Networking and Tim Berners Lee invented Web which are documents stored in the server computer which can be shared. The documents are written in HTML which is Hypertext Markup Language. Lee specified HTML in 1989 and written browser and server software to read HTML in 1990. 

 CSS which is Cascading Stylesheet is a document which describes how each HTML element will appear on screen, on paper or on media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. CSS was proposed in October 10, 1994 by Hakon Wium Lie. 

Charles F. Goldfarb, Ed Mosher, and Ray Lorie at IBM in the 1970s invented XML which is Extensible Markup Language which is a markup language which encodes language that machine readable and human readable. Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax then have been developed such as SVG and XHTML. 

 

Question 3 

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words) 

The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet e.g. www.google.com 

Web servers or Web browsers interact through eProtocol (IP) addresses. 

DNS translates Domains (domain names) to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources and eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), by converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet
